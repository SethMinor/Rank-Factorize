# Rank-Factorize
A low-level approach to computing the rank factorization of a given matrix- an exercise in understanding matrix factorizations.

The 'RankFacotrize.py' python source code documents my NumPy-based saga.

The 'gram_schmidt' function included in the script was not developed by me.

Try it on a given m x n matrix!
